\chapter{Tools and Technologies}
The development of the mathVoyage software project relies on a carefully chosen set of tools and technologies to ensure its robustness, efficiency, and versatility. Leveraging industry-standard and well-established resources, we are committed to creating a reliable mathematical library that will be accessible to developers across diverse domains. In this section, we provide a comprehensive overview of the software development tools, programming languages, libraries, and technologies that will underpin the mathVoyage project. These tools have been thoughtfully selected to facilitate efficient development and seamless integration of mathematical functionalities, empowering users to harness the power of mathematics in their applications with ease and precision.

\section{Programming Language}
As we want to build this library for \textbf{JAVA} based applications we are going to choose \textbf{JAVA} for this library.

\section{Development Environment}
The mathVoyage software project will be developed using Java within the IntelliJ IDEA integrated development environment for coding, debugging and documenting.

\section{Version Control}
The project's source code will be managed using a Git repository hosted on GitHub, with individual branches dedicated to each contributor to maintain the chronological order of contributions.

\section{Documentation Tools}
Project documentation, including code comments, user manuals, and will be generated and maintained using Javadoc within the IntelliJ IDEA integrated development environment.

\section{Collaboration Tools}
Communication and collaboration among team members will be facilitated through a Discord server, while online meetings and discussions will be conducted using Google Meet.

\section{Performance Optimization}

\subsection{Matrix Multiplication}
For matrix multiplication, we will implement the Strassen algorithm to optimize performance. Additionally, based on the diverse features provided earlier, we are considering the implementation of other matrix-related algorithms to enhance the module's capabilities.

\subsection{Trigonometric Functions}
Trigonometric calculations will be performed using the Maclaurin and Taylor series methods to ensure accuracy, providing up to four digits of precision after the decimal point for precise results.\\

In the realm of performance optimization, our commitment to efficiency and precision shines through. By implementing the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication, we are poised to significantly enhance computational speed, especially when dealing with large matrices. Furthermore, our dedication to accuracy in trigonometric function calculations, achieved through the Maclaurin and Taylor series methods, will enable mathVoyage to deliver results with up to four digits of precision after the decimal point. These performance optimization strategies reflect our unwavering commitment to providing users with a robust mathematical toolkit that excels in both speed and precision, catering to a wide range of mathematical and scientific applications.\\\\

In this chapter, we've outlined the foundational tools and technologies driving the development of the mathVoyage software project. With Java as our core programming language and IntelliJ IDEA as our development environment, we're poised to create a versatile mathematical library. Git and GitHub will manage our source code, ensuring organized contributions. Javadoc within IntelliJ IDEA will maintain clear documentation, while Discord and Google Meet will foster team collaboration.\\

Our commitment to performance optimization includes the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication, enhancing speed for large matrices. Trigonometric accuracy, with up to four decimal places, will be achieved through the Maclaurin and Taylor series methods. These choices reflect our dedication to providing a powerful, precise, and accessible mathematical toolkit for developers across various domains.
